SQL aliases are used to temporarily rename a table or a column heading.

Aliases can be useful when:
There are more than one table involved in a query
Functions are used in the query
Column names are big or not very readable
Two or more columns are combined together



SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;

Example:
1.  SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
    FROM Customers;

2.1 SELECT CustomerName, Address+', '+City+', '+PostalCode+', '+Country AS Address
    FROM Customers;
2.2 SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',City,', ',PostalCode,', ',Country) AS Address
    FROM Customers;
    
3.  SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
    FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
    WHERE c.CustomerName="Around the Horn" AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
