The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). 
So you should only create indexes on columns (and tables) that will be frequently searched against.

Example:
1. The SQL statement below creates an index named "PIndex" on the "LastName" column in the "Persons" table:
CREATE INDEX PIndex
ON Persons (LastName)

2. If you want to create an index on a combination of columns, 
you can list the column names within the parentheses, separated by commas:
CREATE INDEX PIndex
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName)
