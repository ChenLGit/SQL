SELECT column_name(s)
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM table1;

Example:
1. Use the IN clause to copy the table into another database:

SELECT *
INTO CustomersBackup2013 IN 'Backup.mdb'
FROM Customers;

2. Copy only the German customers into the new table:

SELECT *
INTO CustomersBackup2013
FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';

3. Copy data from more than one table into the new table:

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
INTO CustomersOrderBackup2013
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;
